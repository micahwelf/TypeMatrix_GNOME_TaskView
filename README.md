# TypeMatrix_GNOME_TaskView
AutoHotKey scripts for making Windows 10 behave a little more efficiently, GNOME style. Also, 
script(s) to add a little convenience that could apply to any desktop/work environment.

Mouse to TopLeft, or the left Win key, starts Task View.  With moving the Taskbar to the top of
the screen, this essencially makes the system mimic Gnome's Win-key behavior and appearance.

The origins of creation are varied and un-tracable -- Also the nature of these small scripts makes
it difficult to be tedious with credit-giving after just a few modifications by non-original
authors.  To the best of my knowledge this is available as Public Domain, and I have presented
it here as such, with the exception that all the executables are GPL v2 licensed by the AutoHotKey
project.
