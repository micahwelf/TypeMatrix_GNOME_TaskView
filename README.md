# TypeMatrix_GNOME_TaskView
AutoHotKey scripts for making Windows 10 behave a little more efficiently, GNOME style.

Mouse to TopLeft, or the left Win key, starts Task View.  With moving the Taskbar to the top of
the screen, this essencially makes the system mimic Gnome's Win-key behavior. Any other Win-key
shortcuts that involve pressing the Win-key first will have to be manually, explicitly programmed
in AutoHotKey, however, since stealing
the Win-key has the side effect that when Win-key is pressed (without another modified pressed first)
MS Windows does not recieve it at all.  If Ctrl is pressed first, Ctrl+LWin+{Rigmt,Left} still
switches desktops, etc. Try tweaking this behavior until you find what you want! 

The origins of creation are varied and un-tracable -- Also the nature of these small scripts makes
it difficult to be tedious with credit-giving after just a few modifications by non-original
authors.  To the best of my knowledge this is available as Public Domain, and I have presented
it here as such, with the exception that all the executables are GPL v2 licensed by the AutoHotKey
project.
